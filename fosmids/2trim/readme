python grabtrim.py

takes 14 bp of the fosmid vector (which only consists of the first and last 100 bp of the vector as these are the regions most likely to be ligated)
and 14bp of both the p5 and p7 adapter
also accounts for the reverse complement

first does bbmap to remove contaminants
trims using cutadapt and trimmomatic
and merge reads using flash
